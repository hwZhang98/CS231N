# # What's this TensorFlow business?
# 
# You've written a lot of code in this assignment to provide a whole host of neural network functionality. Dropout, Batch Norm, and 2D convolutions are some of the workhorses of deep learning in computer vision. You've also worked hard to make your code efficient and vectorized.
# 
# For the last part of this assignment, though, we're going to leave behind your beautiful codebase and instead migrate to one of two popular deep learning frameworks: in this instance, TensorFlow (or PyTorch, if you choose to work with that notebook).

# #### What is it?
# TensorFlow is a system for executing computational graphs over Tensor objects, with native support for performing backpropogation for its Variables. In it, we work with Tensors which are n-dimensional arrays analogous to the numpy ndarray.
# 
# #### Why?
# 
# * Our code will now run on GPUs! Much faster training. Writing your own modules to run on GPUs is beyond the scope of this class, unfortunately.
# * We want you to be ready to use one of these frameworks for your project so you can experiment more efficiently than if you were writing every feature you want to use by hand. 
# * We want you to stand on the shoulders of giants! TensorFlow and PyTorch are both excellent frameworks that will make your lives a lot easier, and now that you understand their guts, you are free to use them :) 
# * We want you to be exposed to the sort of deep learning code you might run into in academia or industry. 

# ## How will I learn TensorFlow?
# 
# TensorFlow has many excellent tutorials available, including those from [Google themselves](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started).
# 
# Otherwise, this notebook will walk you through much of what you need to do to train models in TensorFlow. See the end of the notebook for some links to helpful tutorials if you want to learn more or need further clarification on topics that aren't fully explained here.
# 
# **NOTE: This notebook is meant to teach you the latest version of Tensorflow 2.0. Most examples on the web today are still in 1.x, so be careful not to confuse the two when looking up documentation**.
# 
# ## Install Tensorflow 2.0
# Tensorflow 2.0 is still not in a fully 100% stable release, but it's still usable and more intuitive than TF 1.x. Please make sure you have it installed before moving on in this notebook! Here are some steps to get started:
# 
# 1. Have the latest version of Anaconda installed on your machine.
# 2. Create a new conda environment starting from Python 3.7. In this setup example, we'll call it `tf_20_env`.
# 3. Run the command: `source activate tf_20_env`
# 4. Then pip install TF 2.0 as described here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip 
# 
# A guide on creating Anaconda enviornments: https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/
# 
# This will give you an new enviornemnt to play in TF 2.0. Generally, if you plan to also use TensorFlow in your other projects, you might also want to keep a seperate Conda environment or virtualenv in Python 3.7 that has Tensorflow 1.9, so you can switch back and forth at will. 

# # Table of Contents
# 
# This notebook has 5 parts. We will walk through TensorFlow at **three different levels of abstraction**, which should help you better understand it and prepare you for working on your project.
# 
# 1. Part I, Preparation: load the CIFAR-10 dataset.
# 2. Part II, Barebone TensorFlow: **Abstraction Level 1**, we will work directly with low-level TensorFlow graphs. 
# 3. Part III, Keras Model API: **Abstraction Level 2**, we will use `tf.keras.Model` to define arbitrary neural network architecture. 
# 4. Part IV, Keras Sequential + Functional API: **Abstraction Level 3**, we will use `tf.keras.Sequential` to define a linear feed-forward network very conveniently, and then explore the functional libraries for building unique and uncommon models that require more flexibility.
# 5. Part V, CIFAR-10 open-ended challenge: please implement your own network to get as high accuracy as possible on CIFAR-10. You can experiment with any layer, optimizer, hyperparameters or other advanced features. 
# 
# We will discuss Keras in more detail later in the notebook.
# 
# Here is a table of comparison:
# 
# | API           | Flexibility | Convenience |
# |---------------|-------------|-------------|
# | Barebone      | High        | Low         |
# | `tf.keras.Model`     | High        | Medium      |
# | `tf.keras.Sequential` | Low         | High        |

# # Part I: Preparation
# 
# First, we load the CIFAR-10 dataset. This might take a few minutes to download the first time you run it, but after that the files should be cached on disk and loading should be faster.
# 
# In previous parts of the assignment we used CS231N-specific code to download and read the CIFAR-10 dataset; however the `tf.keras.datasets` package in TensorFlow provides prebuilt utility functions for loading many common datasets.
# 
# For the purposes of this assignment we will still write our own code to preprocess the data and iterate through it in minibatches. The `tf.data` package in TensorFlow provides tools for automating this process, but working with this package adds extra complication and is beyond the scope of this notebook. However using `tf.data` can be much more efficient than the simple approach used in this notebook, so you should consider using it for your project.

# # Part II: Barebones TensorFlow
# TensorFlow ships with various high-level APIs which make it very convenient to define and train neural networks; we will cover some of these constructs in Part III and Part IV of this notebook. In this section we will start by building a model with basic TensorFlow constructs to help you better understand what's going on under the hood of the higher-level APIs.
# 
# **"Barebones Tensorflow" is important to understanding the building blocks of TensorFlow, but much of it involves concepts from TensorFlow 1.x.** We will be working with legacy modules such as `tf.Variable`.
# 
# Therefore, please read and understand the differences between legacy (1.x) TF and the new (2.0) TF.
# 
# ### Historical background on TensorFlow 1.x
# 
# TensorFlow 1.x is primarily a framework for working with **static computational graphs**. Nodes in the computational graph are Tensors which will hold n-dimensional arrays when the graph is run; edges in the graph represent functions that will operate on Tensors when the graph is run to actually perform useful computation.
# 
# Before Tensorflow 2.0, we had to configure the graph into two phases. There are plenty of tutorials online that explain this two-step process. The process generally looks like the following for TF 1.x:
# 1. **Build a computational graph that describes the computation that you want to perform**. This stage doesn't actually perform any computation; it just builds up a symbolic representation of your computation. This stage will typically define one or more `placeholder` objects that represent inputs to the computational graph.
# 2. **Run the computational graph many times.** Each time the graph is run (e.g. for one gradient descent step) you will specify which parts of the graph you want to compute, and pass a `feed_dict` dictionary that will give concrete values to any `placeholder`s in the graph.
# 
# ### The new paradigm in Tensorflow 2.0
# Now, with Tensorflow 2.0, we can simply adopt a functional form that is more Pythonic and similar in spirit to PyTorch and direct Numpy operation. Instead of the 2-step paradigm with computation graphs, making it (among other things) easier to debug TF code. You can read more details at https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager.
# 
# The main difference between the TF 1.x and 2.0 approach is that the 2.0 approach doesn't make use of `tf.Session`, `tf.run`, `placeholder`, `feed_dict`. To get more details of what's different between the two version and how to convert between the two, check out the official migration guide: https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/migration_guide
# 
# Later, in the rest of this notebook we'll focus on this new, simpler approach.

# ### TensorFlow warmup: Flatten Function
# 
# We can see this in action by defining a simple `flatten` function that will reshape image data for use in a fully-connected network.
# 
# In TensorFlow, data for convolutional feature maps is typically stored in a Tensor of shape N x H x W x C where:
# 
# - N is the number of datapoints (minibatch size)
# - H is the height of the feature map
# - W is the width of the feature map
# - C is the number of channels in the feature map
# 
# This is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a "flatten" operation to collapse the `H x W x C` values per representation into a single long vector. 
# 
# Notice the `tf.reshape` call has the target shape as `(N, -1)`, meaning it will reshape/keep the first dimension to be N, and then infer as necessary what the second dimension is in the output, so we can collapse the remaining dimensions from the input properly.
# 
# **NOTE**: TensorFlow and PyTorch differ on the default Tensor layout; TensorFlow uses N x H x W x C but PyTorch uses N x C x H x W.

For now we will use only low-level TensorFlow operators to define the network; later we will see how to use the higher-level abstractions provided by `tf.keras` to simplify the process.
# 
# We will define the forward pass of the network in the function `two_layer_fc`; this will accept TensorFlow Tensors for the inputs and weights of the network, and return a TensorFlow Tensor for the scores. 
# 
# After defining the network architecture in the `two_layer_fc` function, we will test the implementation by checking the shape of the output.

Learnable parameters of the network are usually stored in Variables.

# # Part III: Keras Model Subclassing API
# 
# Implementing a neural network using the low-level TensorFlow API is a good way to understand how TensorFlow works, but it's a little inconvenient - we had to manually keep track of all Tensors holding learnable parameters. This was fine for a small network, but could quickly become unweildy for a large complex model.
# 
# Fortunately TensorFlow 2.0 provides higher-level APIs such as `tf.keras` which make it easy to build models out of modular, object-oriented layers. Further, TensorFlow 2.0 uses eager execution that evaluates operations immediately, without explicitly constructing any computational graphs. This makes it easy to write and debug models, and reduces the boilerplate code.
# 
# In this part of the notebook we will define neural network models using the `tf.keras.Model` API. To implement your own model, you need to do the following:
# 
# 1. Define a new class which subclasses `tf.keras.Model`. Give your class an intuitive name that describes it, like `TwoLayerFC` or `ThreeLayerConvNet`.
# 2. In the initializer `__init__()` for your new class, define all the layers you need as class attributes. The `tf.keras.layers` package provides many common neural-network layers, like `tf.keras.layers.Dense` for fully-connected layers and `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` for convolutional layers. Under the hood, these layers will construct `Variable` Tensors for any learnable parameters. **Warning**: Don't forget to call `super(YourModelName, self).__init__()` as the first line in your initializer!
# 3. Implement the `call()` method for your class; this implements the forward pass of your model, and defines the *connectivity* of your network. Layers defined in `__init__()` implement `__call__()` so they can be used as function objects that transform input Tensors into output Tensors. Don't define any new layers in `call()`; any layers you want to use in the forward pass should be defined in `__init__()`.
# 
# After you define your `tf.keras.Model` subclass, you can instantiate it and use it like the model functions from Part II.
# 
# ### Keras Model Subclassing API: Two-Layer Network
# 
# Here is a concrete example of using the `tf.keras.Model` API to define a two-layer network. There are a few new bits of API to be aware of here:
# 
# We use an `Initializer` object to set up the initial values of the learnable parameters of the layers; in particular `tf.initializers.VarianceScaling` gives behavior similar to the Kaiming initialization method we used in Part II. You can read more about it here: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/initializers/VarianceScaling
# 
# We construct `tf.keras.layers.Dense` objects to represent the two fully-connected layers of the model. In addition to multiplying their input by a weight matrix and adding a bias vector, these layer can also apply a nonlinearity for you. For the first layer we specify a ReLU activation function by passing `activation='relu'` to the constructor; the second layer uses softmax activation function. Finally, we use `tf.keras.layers.Flatten` to flatten the output from the previous fully-connected layer.

    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super(TwoLayerFC, self).__init__()

        self.fc1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(hidden_size, activation='relu',
                                   kernel_initializer=initializer)
        self.fc2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax',
                                   kernel_initializer=initializer)
        self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()

# 
# 1. Convolutional layer with 5 x 5 kernels, with zero-padding of 2
# 2. ReLU nonlinearity

# ### Keras Model Subclassing API: Eager Training
# 
# While keras models have a builtin training loop (using the `model.fit`), sometimes you need more customization. Here's an example, of a training loop implemented with eager execution.
# 
# In particular, notice `tf.GradientTape`. Automatic differentiation is used in the backend for implementing backpropagation in frameworks like TensorFlow. During eager execution, `tf.GradientTape` is used to trace operations for computing gradients later. A particular `tf.GradientTape` can only compute one gradient; subsequent calls to tape will throw a runtime error. 
# 
# TensorFlow 2.0 ships with easy-to-use built-in metrics under `tf.keras.metrics` module. Each metric is an object, and we can use `update_state()` to add observations and `reset_state()` to clear all observations. We can get the current result of a metric by calling `result()` on the metric object.

# # Part IV: Keras Sequential API
# In Part III we introduced the `tf.keras.Model` API, which allows you to define models with any number of learnable layers and with arbitrary connectivity between layers.
# 
# However for many models you don't need such flexibility - a lot of models can be expressed as a sequential stack of layers, with the output of each layer fed to the next layer as input. If your model fits this pattern, then there is an even easier way to define your model: using `tf.keras.Sequential`. You don't need to write any custom classes; you simply call the `tf.keras.Sequential` constructor with a list containing a sequence of layer objects.
# 
# One complication with `tf.keras.Sequential` is that you must define the shape of the input to the model by passing a value to the `input_shape` of the first layer in your model.
#

# ##  Part IV: Functional API
# ### Demonstration with a Two-Layer Network 
# 
# In the previous section, we saw how we can use `tf.keras.Sequential` to stack layers to quickly build simple models. But this comes at the cost of losing flexibility.
# 
# Often we will have to write complex models that have non-sequential data flows: a layer can have **multiple inputs and/or outputs**, such as stacking the output of 2 previous layers together to feed as input to a third! (Some examples are residual connections and dense blocks.)
# 
# In such cases, we can use Keras functional API to write models with complex topologies such as:
# 
#  1. Multi-input models
#  2. Multi-output models
#  3. Models with shared layers (the same layer called several times)
#  4. Models with non-sequential data flows (e.g. residual connections)
# 
# Writing a model with Functional API requires us to create a `tf.keras.Model` instance and explicitly write input tensors and output tensors for this model.

# # Part V: CIFAR-10 open-ended challenge
# 
# In this section you can experiment with whatever ConvNet architecture you'd like on CIFAR-10.
# 
# You should experiment with architectures, hyperparameters, loss functions, regularization, or anything else you can think of to train a model that achieves **at least 70%** accuracy on the **validation** set within 10 epochs. You can use the built-in train function, the `train_part34` function from above, or implement your own training loop.
# 
# Describe what you did at the end of the notebook.
# 
# ### Some things you can try:
# - **Filter size**: Above we used 5x5 and 3x3; is this optimal?
# - **Number of filters**: Above we used 16 and 32 filters. Would more or fewer do better?
# - **Pooling**: We didn't use any pooling above. Would this improve the model?
# - **Normalization**: Would your model be improved with batch normalization, layer normalization, group normalization, or some other normalization strategy?
# - **Network architecture**: The ConvNet above has only three layers of trainable parameters. Would a deeper model do better?
# - **Global average pooling**: Instead of flattening after the final convolutional layer, would global average pooling do better? This strategy is used for example in Google's Inception network and in Residual Networks.
# - **Regularization**: Would some kind of regularization improve performance? Maybe weight decay or dropout?
# 
# ### NOTE: Batch Normalization / Dropout
# If you are using Batch Normalization and Dropout, remember to pass `is_training=True` if you use the `train_part34()` function. BatchNorm and Dropout layers have different behaviors at training and inference time. `training` is a specific keyword argument reserved for this purpose in any `tf.keras.Model`'s `call()` function. Read more about this here : https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization#methods
# https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dropout#methods
# 
# ### Tips for training
# For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind: 
# 
# - If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations
# - Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.
# - Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.
# - You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.
# 
# ### Going above and beyond
# If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!
# 
# - Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.
# - Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.
# - Model ensembles
# - Data augmentation
# - New Architectures
#   - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.
#   - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.
#   - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)

# ### Have fun and happy training!
